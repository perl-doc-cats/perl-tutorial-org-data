perl-tutorial.org base
======================

This repository contains the actual wiki contents and some styling of the site
http://perl-tutorial.org

Changes in here are automatically synched to the server whenever the wiki
software is prompted to rebuild, meaning either:

- a page is edited
- `ikiwiki -setup ~/PerlTutorialHub.setup` is executed on the server
- an admin user goes into `Preferences > Setup` and clicks `Save`

Additionally any changes done on the wiki will be pushed to this repo. It is
the actual database used by the wiki software to store page contents.

So, if you do not like web interfaces too much, you can just push to this repo
and do any of the above to get your changes online. If you find that you are not
able to do what you desire, feel free to swing by in IRC or contact any of the
people on the [perl-tutorial contact page](http://perl-tutorial.org/contact/) to
get the changes online, an admin flag or your ssh key onto the server.
