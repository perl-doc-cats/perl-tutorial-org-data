The quickest way to contact us is in the [[IRC channel|https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.perl.org/perl-faq]]. If you do not have an IRC client, [[HydraIRC|http://www.hydrairc.com/]] is an excellent choice on windows, as is [[irssi|http://irssi.org/]] on Linux.

If you need to contact us, for whatever reason, by other means, you can find more information on our user pages:

* [[Mithaldu]] (Server and Software Administration)
* [[tinita]] (Domain Administration and Design)

Additionally the [perl-doc-cats org](https://github.com/perl-doc-cats) has read/write access to the repos, so in a pinch you can also try contacting them via github.

You can also contact us by email: info (at) perl-tutorial.org
