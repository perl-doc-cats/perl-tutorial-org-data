#Introduction

Just as one of Perl's main tenets is "There Is More Than One Way To Do It", there is more than one way to learn it. Here we collect and organize the Perl tutorials available on the Internet so you can easily find one that is fresh and suits your taste.

#Recommended Tutorials

These are fresh tutorials that teach a modern style of Perl. They are great for newcomers to learn the language and for seasoned developers to refresh their knowledge or learn new tricks.

# TODO

The site is not yet complete, here are some ideas of what we might want to do with it. Want to help? Stop by in the IRC channel or find out more about the code of the site on the [[about]] page.

* in order to create free page links without breaking the repo on windows the ikiwiki code needs to be adapted to encode page filenames and urls
* country flags for the language?
* figure out how to structure tutorials/howtos written on this site
* add reddit button to the tutorial tables
* a linkable button? "Lean Perl - Your Way" (see promotejs.com)
* needs a proper design
* write an [[Tutorial Author Outreach/Email Template]] to be sent to tutorial authors explaining about perl-tutorial.org and inviting them to keep their entries updated
* send aforementioned email out to authors, will need a [[Tutorial Author Outreach/Contact List]] to track who was sent something
* add a jquery hover tooltip that will show a more detailed description of a tutorial based on a YAML key

# Not Recommended

Here are tutorials that have been looked over and can't be recommended for several reasons. The date of the check is listed. If you think the evaluation is not true anymore let us know.

* http://es.tldp.org/Tutoriales/PERL/tutoperl-html/ - 2003.03.22. 
    name:       Tutorial de PERL en castellano
    type:       Web
    version:    5.6
    covers:     Perl Basics
    size:       Small
    lang:       ES
    status:     Complete

* http://www.perltutorial.org/ - 2011-11-04 - does not use strict, warnings or my() anywhere in the main tutorial; introduces c-style for loop (a foreach style loop is used later but not explained); suggests subroutine calls with ampersand without explaining

* http://www.tizag.com/perlT/ - 2011-11-05 - Besides the weak orthography and diction, numerous mistakes and shortcomings. There is hardly is a chapter without errors. These are the most egregious of the first 12:

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/

        > PERL

        The name of the language is [Perl](http://learn.perl.org/faq/perlfaq1.html#Whats-the-difference-between-perl-and-Perl-).

        > the latest version of Perl (currently 5.10)

        The [stable version](http://perl.org/get.html) is 5.14.

        > a PERL file must be saved with a .pl (.PL) file extension in order to be recognized as a functioning PERL script.

        The file extension holds no sway over the functioning of a script. Scripts with a non-customary extension or without one work just fine.

        > File names [&hellip;] must not contain a space.

        File names of scripts may contain spaces.


    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlfirstscript.php

        > Your script is working perfectly if you are staring at a blank screen

        The description does not fit the code. Just as before, &ldquo;[y]ou should see "Hello, Perl!" in the top left corner of your browser.&rdquo;.

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlsyntax.php

        The paragraph &ldquo;Escaping Characters&rdquo; does not mention that [string literals can be delimited with different operators](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators) so that content is not interpolated so that the use of backslashes as described becomes unnecessary.

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlvariables.php

        > A variable is defined by the `$` symbol (scalar), the `@` symbol (arrays), or the `%` symbol (hashes).

        A variable is defined by virtue of declaration in its scope. The word define is misused throughout this chapter, it should talk about declaring instead. What the author calls &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; most people call sigil. They do not refer to the type of the variable but the mode of addressing, the expressions `$foo{bar}` and `$foo[42]` or `@foo{qw(bar baz)}` and `@foo[1..7]` do not fit to the description.

        > Variables can be defined either way.

        Teaching this without pointing out the difference is a bad idea. Package variables (here: the ones declared without my) are a hold-over from the era before Perl 5, about 15 years ago. As written in the tutorial, the program will not work under the strict pragma whose usage has been recommended for years everywhere: &ldquo;Global symbol "$somenumber" requires explicit package name at definestrings.pl line 6. &hellip; Execution of definestrings.pl aborted due to compilation errors.&rdquo; The tutorial should only teach lexical variables (here: the ones declared with my).

        > my parameter

        [my is a function](http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/my.html).

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlstrings.php

        > q subfunction

        [q is an operator](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators). There is no such thing as a subfunction, the author mixed up subroutine and function.

        > formatting characters

        These are called [escape sequences](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html#Escape-sequences). It is not mentioned that the list in the tutorial is incomplete.

        http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlnumbers.php

        > They exist in PERL as real numbers

        The standard Perl distribution, like most languages, comes with no facility for dealing with real numbers. Judging from the code example, the author intended to talk about natural numbers.

        > Here's a few trigonomic functions that will only function if your build of PERL has the Math::Trig module installed.

        The [sine function (sin)](http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/sin.html) is a built-in and therefore works without the module.

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perloperators.php

        > Exponents

        The operator is called exponentiation.

        > Example: 7 le 11

        > Result: True

        The expression `7 le 11` evaluates false.

        > Example: 7 ge 11

        > Result: False

        The expression `7 ge 11` evaluates true.

        > In the table above, the black operators are for numbers and the red ones are for strings.

        The [operators &ldquo;and&rdquo;, &ldquo;or&rdquo;](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Logical-And) are in red. It is wrong to claim that they are for strings.

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlarrays.php

        > qw Subroutine

        [qw is an operator](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Quote-and-Quote-like-Operators).

        > sequentialarrays.pl:

        > @abc = (a .. z);

        > print "@abc<br />";

        > Display:

        > Quarter Dime Nickel

        > QuarterDimeNickel

        This is a copy-paste accident. The output does not fit to the code.

        > we can redefine the array as a scalar variable.

        This is assignment, not redefining.

        > When adding elements using push() or shift()

        shift() removes, unshift() adds.

        > Function: delete $array[index]

        > Definition: Removes an element by index number

        Only if it is the last one, usually the element is replaced with undef. Using the [delete function](http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/delete.html) on arrays is deprecated, there's no point in teaching it.

        > The sort() function sorts each element of an array according to ASCII Numeric standards.

        To the Unicode standard, no special collation rules, comparing codepoints only.

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlwhile.php

        The example whilearrayloop.pl contains a trap. The while loop aborts prematurely if the array contains a false element, such as 0, the empty string or undef.

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlhashes.php

        > We need to edit our hash to and change is the values to floating-point numbers.

        This whole part is totally confusing. The problem can be solved straight-forward by keeping the integer numbers, using the spaceship operator <=> to compare numerically instead of using the cmp operator to compare stringwise.

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlfilehandle.php

        The program in the paragraph &ldquo;Assigning Handles&rdquo; is not working. It won't compile because of the missing semicolon after the variable assignment. The sysopen call fails because the bareword `O_RDWR` is co&euml;rced to 0. To make the sysopen calls work as intended, one first needs to import the topical constants from the Fcntl module: `use Fcntl qw(O_RDWR O_EXCL O_CREAT);`

        > sysopen(HANDLE, $FilePath, O_RDWR);

        Instead of the problematic bareword filehandles, [indirect filehandles](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlopentut.html#Indirect-Filehandles) should be taught.

        > printf HANDLE "Welcome to Tizag!";

        This is a trap. Should the string contain a format expression such as `%s`, it will be discarded. `print` should be used instead.

        > sysopen (HTML, '$filepath', O_RDWR|O_EXCL|O_CREAT, 0755) or die "$filepath cannot be opened.";

        The message is lacking the error message from the system. The `$!` variable should be added, or better yet, `autodie` should be taught.

        > printf HTML "<html>\n";

        > printf HTML "<head>\n";

        > printf HTML "<title>My Home Page</title>";

        > printf HTML "</head>\n";

        > printf HTML "<body>\n";

        Line-wrapping strings and heredoc strings should be taught.

    * http://www.tizag.com/perlT/perlfileopen.php

        In the paragraph &ldquo;Open a File&rdquo;:

        > $FH = "filehandle";

        This variable `$FH` is defined, but not used later.

        > open(FH, $FilePath, permissions);

        The syntax is wrong. The mode goes in the middle.

        > sysopen(FH, $FileName, permission);

        The variable `$FileName` was not defined.

        The next paragraph &ldquo;File Permissions&rdquo; does not talk about permissions, but access modes.

        > Here's a listing of what to pass to the open function when working with file handles.

        > < or r

        The open function only recognises the mode as used in shell, not the mode as used in C. That will provoke the diagnostic &ldquo;Unknown open() mode 'r' at &hellip;&rdquo;.
rdquo; does not talk about permissions, but access modes.
